About me
======
I am graduate student in [Colin Hill’s](http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~jch/) group, working on observational cosmology. I study the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, specifically the kinematic and thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich Effects, which probe ionized gas in distant galaxies. I am also interested in large scale structure, galaxy formation from a cosmologist perspective, and data science applications in cosmology and astrophysics.

I am a member of the [Atacama Cosmology Telescope](https://act.princeton.edu/) and the [Simons Observatory](https://simonsobservatory.org/).

I got my BA in Physics from University of Pennsylvania in 2019.
